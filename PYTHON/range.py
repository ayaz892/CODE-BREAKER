#The roles of the range(start, stop, step) function parameters are:



# This loop iterates on the value of the "n" variable in a range
# of 0 to 10 (the value of the end-of-range index 11 is excluded).
# The incremental value for the loop is 2. The print() function will 
# output the resulting value of "n" as the loop counts from 0 to 10 
# (end-of-range index 11) in incremental steps of 2. This is one 
# method that can be used in Python to print a list of even numbers.


for n in range(0,11,2):
    print(n)


# The loop should print 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10

# This loop iterates on the value of the "number" variable in a range
# of 2 to 7+1 (the value of the end-of-range index 7 is excluded, so 
# +1 has been added to the parameter to include the numeric value 7 in 
# the range). The incremental value for the loop is the default of +1.
# The print() function will output the resulting value of "number" 
# multiplied by 3.


for number in range(2,7+1):
    print(number*3)


# The loop should print 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21

# This loop iterates on the value of the "x" variable in a range
# of 2 to -1 (the end-of-range index -2 is excluded). The third 
# parameter is also a negative number, making it a decremental value
# of -1. The print() function will output the resulting value of
# "x" as it starts at 2 and counts down to -1 (index -2).


for x in range(2, -2, -1):
    print(x)


# The loop should print 2, 1, 0, -1
